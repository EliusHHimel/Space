# Stella - Space For Everyone

This is a single-page web application built with React.js. I've built this app to practice my React skills and to learn more about the React ecosystem.

## Running the app
To run the app, clone this repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm start` to start the app. The app will be available at `localhost:3000`.

## Building the app
To build the app, run `npm run build`. The build will be available in the `build` folder.

## Deploying the app
To deploy the app, run `npm run deploy`. This will build the app and deploy it to GitHub Pages. But remember to change the `homepage` field in `package.json` to your own GitHub Pages URL.
